							; used only if it is forced and enabled.

							; channel. Defaults to "no".

;jbmaxsize = 200					; Max length of the jitterbuffer in milliseconds.

;jbresyncthreshold = 1000				; Jump in the frame timestamps over which the jitterbuffer is
							; resynchronized. Useful to improve the quality of the voice, with
							; big jumps in/broken timestamps, usually sent from exotic devices
							; and programs. Defaults to 1000.

;jbimpl = fixed						; Jitterbuffer implementation, used on the receiving side of a
							; sccp channel. Two implementations are currently available
							; - "fixed" (with size always equals to jbmaxsize)
							; - "adaptive" (with variable size, actually the new jb of IAX2).
							; Defaults to fixed.

;jblog = no						; Enables jitterbuffer frame logging. Defaults to "no".
