	  configuration
	  is now one of the following (one of these is necessary to
	  recognize if
	  it is a line or device):
	  - cid_num
	  - cid_name
	  - label
	  - pin
	  
	  Initial Bug Report:
	  Both sample configs (sccp.conf and sccp_short.conf) in current
	  trunk
	  (rev. 1056) does not work. There is missing "button" keyword in
	  lines
	  definition which causes asterisk to ignore them on initial
	  sccp.conf
	  load (it complains about Unknown type - sccp_config.c line 637).
	  In case
	  I add line "button = 1" into [defaultline] template it works like
	  charm.
