 *
 * \subsection nf_hotline How to use the hotline option
 *
 * Setting the hotline Feature on a device, will make it connect to a predefined extension as soon as the Receiver
 * is picked up or the "New Call" Button is pressed. No number has to be given. This works even on devices which 
 * have no entry in the config file or realtime database. 
 *
 * The hotline function can be used in different circumstances, for example at a door, where you want people to be 
 * able to only call one number, or for unprovisioned phones to only be able to call the helpdesk to get their phone
 * set up.
 *
 * For example:
 * \code
 *   - hotline_enabled=yes
 *   - hotline_context=default
 *   - hotline_extension=111
 * \endcode
 * This will add a Hotline on all phones, dialing 111 via context default.
