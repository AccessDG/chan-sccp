/**
 * \page 	what_sccp 		What is Chan_SCCP
 *
 * \section 	what_is_chan_sccp 	What is Chan_SCCP
 * 
 * Chan_SCCP is a replacement Channel Driver for chan_skinny in the Asterisk Channel Driver Library. It delivers
 * better performance, scalability, interoperability and functionality than either chan_skinny or chan_sip on a 
 * SCCP capable phone. It is still under heavy development but a stable release is also available for you to use.
 * 
 * \subsection 	what_sccp_ss1		SCCP in relation to SIP/IAX/MGCP
 *
 * There are several methods to communicate with a VOIP Server. Next to the well known SIP Protocol there are 
 * Several others like: MGCP, IAX, IAX2, SS7 and SCCP. The SCCP protocol is sometimes refered to as SKINNY. 
 * 
 * Several VOIP Phone Resellers have create phones that use the SCCP Protocol. The most well known at this moment
 * is CISCO, but there are others like Kirk, Ixia, Symbol Techologies, SocketIP, Digium and Nokia.
 *
 * IPBlue markets a software phone (soft phone) which uses SCCP for signaling and emulates a Cisco 7960 hardware phone.
 *
 * \subsection 	what_sccp_ss2 		SCCP as a Protocol
 * 
 * The Skinny Call Control Protocol a.k.a Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP, Q.713, or short Skinny) is a 
 * proprietary network terminal control protocol originally developed by Selsius Corporation. The term "Skinny" 
 * reflects that SCCP is a simple and uncomplicated ("lightweight") protocol requiring relatively little computer 
 * processing. 
 * 
 * The SCCP technology is now owned and defined by Cisco Systems, Inc. as a messaging system between a Skinny 
 * client and the Cisco CallManager. Examples of skinny clients include the Cisco 7900 series of IP phones, 
 * Cisco IP Communicator softphone and the 802.11b wireless Cisco 7920.
 * 
 * Skinny is a lightweight protocol which allows for efficient communication with Asterisk. The SCCP Protocol 
 * is a lower level protocol when compared to for example SIP. It works on Layer 3/4 of the OSI Layer Model.
 *
 * The SCCP protocol layer supports connectionless and connection-oriented protocol services, 
 * and network management procedures are carried out on a per protocol service basis, that is, network management
 * procedures at SCCP are independently treated for connectionless and for connection-oriented protocol services. 
 *
 * It uses the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) over UDP-transport for the bearer traffic (real-time audio stream) 
 * with other Skinny clients or an H.323 terminal. SCCP is a stimulus-based protocol and is designed as a 
 * communications protocol for hardware endpoints and other embedded systems, with significant CPU and memory constraints.

 *
 * \section unix UNIX, BSD and Linux
 * These instructions are valid for most UNIX-like operating systems, including BSD and
 * Linux variants.
 *
 * \subsection unix_pr Prerequisites
 * The following prerequisites are required:
 *   - A bourne shell (/bin/sh) that is capable of running the supplied configure script.
 *   - Installed version of Asterisk starting at version 1.2
 *   - Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
 *     - The GNU C compiler or another supported C compiler.

 *   - Download the Chan_SCCP sources. 
 *   - Extract the source tree to a clean directory.
 *   - To get started with configure please run: \n
 *     ./bootstrap.sh
 *   - run configure --help to get a list of all the possible configure flags\n
 *     ./configure
 *   - Run make.
 *   - Run make install

 * 
 * 
 * \subsection sccp_config_howto How to use the config file
 *
 * Please check out ./conf/sccp.conf for all possible sccp configuration parameters. This new config file uses standard 
 * asterisk templating to keep your config file shorter and easier to manager. For an untemplated version check-out

 *
 *   - Copy the SCCP Firmware to your tftp directory
 *   - Set the Firmware version in OS79XX.TXT. It should containt only on line, like this:
 *     \code

 *     \endcode
 *   - Set the XMLDefault.cnf.xml to should contain every used device and it firmware. It should look like this:
 *     \code
 *     <Default>

/**
 * \page faq Frequently Asked Questions
 * 
 * Here, you can find the answers to a few frequently asked questions.
 * For up to date Help, Faq, Bug Reporting have a look here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/chan-sccp-b/support.
 * 
 * \section a A. Compilation
 * Compilation related issues.
 *
 * \subsection a1 A1. How to Compile
 * Q: How to Compile chan_sccp-b
 *
 * A: We are using the standard autoconf/automake principle. This means the only thing
 * you have to do to compile your application is run:
 * \code
 * ./configure
 * ./make
 * ./make install
 * \endcode
 * To get everything install using the default values. It will try and determine all the 
 * relevant dependecies and compile the application.
 * If you need any specific functionality, or need to specify a location of for example
 * your asterisk installatin you can use "\code./configure --help\endcode" to figure out the
 * switches you need. 
 * To Read more about using ./configure, read the INSTALL document in the root of this project 
 * directory.
 *
 * \subsection a2 A2. Compilation Errors
 * Q: How to solve compilations errors
 *
 * A: First try to work out what ./configure is complaining about, when it is. I normally tries to
 * be as explicit as possible. If you get errors trying to start configure, first try to resolve it
 * using "\code./reconf\endcode", it will try and build a new configure application for your machine 
 * (autoconf, automake and m4 are required).
 * 
 * If nothing helps, send a message to our bug page via http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=186378&atid=917045.
 * Please include config.log when sending a bug about configure/make
